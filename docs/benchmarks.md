# Benchmarks

Measurements of one machine and configuration. They are hypotheses about performance, not
production claims; rerun them on your own hardware before drawing conclusions.

## Environment (2026-10-13)

- 16 vCPU VM (`Genuine Intel(R) 0000`, Proxmox kernel 7.0.14-17-pve), local NVMe-backed disk.
- Rust 1.101 nightly toolchain for builds; `--release`.
- `quepaxa` at the commit that introduced this file; default `Config` except as noted.

## Core hot paths (`cargo bench -p quepaxa --bench replica`)

CPU only: messages are delivered and persists acknowledged in memory, no I/O.

| Benchmark | Time per op |
|---|---|
| `single_member_propose_to_commit` (propose → persist → commit, 1 replica) | 2.07 µs |
| `three_members_leader_propose_to_commit` (leader fast path, 3 replicas) | 5.63 µs |
| `reject_malformed_message` (decode and drop a bad frame) | 29 ns |

## End to end (`examples/kv-tokio/run-local.sh <rate> <secs> [delay-ms]`)

Three `kv-tokio` processes on loopback, each persisting with `fsync` to its own data
directory; `kv-bench` drives an open-loop Poisson workload in the Go reference
implementation's shape — 17-byte commands (1-byte operation, 8-byte key, 8-byte value),
50% `PUT` / 50% `GET` (linearizable, via read barriers), random keys from a 52-letter
alphabet — over 24 pipelined connections spread across the replicas, 5 s per point.
Requests unanswered 5 s after the run are counted separately; none occurred.

| Offered rate | Achieved | Errors | p50 | p90 | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5,000/s | 4,974/s | 0 | 0.29 ms | 0.58 ms | 0.95 ms |
| 20,000/s | 20,095/s | 0 | 0.33 ms | 0.50 ms | 1.0 ms |
| 50,000/s | 49,943/s | 0 | 0.42 ms | 0.63 ms | 1.8 ms |
| 100,000/s | 99,841/s | 0 | 0.58 ms | 0.92 ms | 14.0 ms |
| 150,000/s | 149,843/s | 0 | 0.72 ms | 1.2 ms | 26.5 ms |
| 200,000/s | 199,903/s | 43 (`Busy`) | 0.81 ms | 1.9 ms | 42.2 ms |
| 250,000/s | 240,314/s | 48,629 (`Busy`) | 1.1 ms | 752 ms | 2,253 ms |

Saturation sets in near 200k operations/s; beyond it `max_outstanding_proposals` (4096
per replica) pushes back with `Busy` instead of queueing without bound. Measured
2026-10-14 (#50) on the same VM while other workloads used 1-3 cores.

Before #50 the same setup saturated near 100k/s (p90 30.7 ms, p99 124 ms at 100k/s). The
changes, each found by measurement:

- **Peer and client I/O batching** (`perf`: 65% of CPU in Tokio workers, about half of
  it in the kernel, one or two syscalls per frame). Frames queued while a batch is being
  written now leave in one `write`; reads go through a 64 KiB buffer; client replies are
  flushed only before waiting on one that is not ready.
- **Snapshots off the event loop** (stall-fills and leader rotations clustered at every
  10,000th slot). The snapshot is encoded once on the loop and written and synced on a
  background thread; the log is compacted once it is durable. Encoding still runs on the
  loop and grows with the state (about 10 ms at 3 MB), which is most of the remaining
  p99 tail.
- **CRC-32C slicing-by-8**: `Record::encode` (dominated by the checksum) went from 6.7%
  to 1.8% of the replica thread's samples.

### Profiling

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C force-frame-pointers=yes" cargo build --profile profiling -p kv-tokio
perf record -F 2999 -g --call-graph fp -p <kv-tokio pid> -- sleep 6   # while kv-bench runs
perf report --no-children --sort sym
```

`kv-bench` prints every replica's `Metrics` after a run (the `STATS` client command), so
retransmits, hedges, forwards and fast-path decisions are visible next to the latencies.

### Simulated WAN

`run-local.sh 5000 8 50` adds a 50 ms one-way `netem` delay to all loopback traffic,
including the client connections (so every client request also pays a 100 ms round trip):

| Offered rate | Achieved | p50 | p90 | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5,000/s | 4,926/s | 319 ms | 596 ms | 919 ms |

The median matches the path: client round trip (100 ms) + forward to the leader (50 ms) +
leader fast path (100 ms) + decision broadcast to the client's replica (50 ms), plus fsync.

## Not measured

- No comparison against the Go reference implementation or Raft libraries yet: running
  the Go code was out of scope of the research (it was read, not built). The workload above
  mirrors its shape so a comparison can be added on the same machine.
- Leader-failure recovery time and heterogeneous WAN placements are covered functionally by
  the simulator (`leader_crash_stalls_commits_only_briefly`) and the `kv-tokio` cluster test,
  not benchmarked here.
